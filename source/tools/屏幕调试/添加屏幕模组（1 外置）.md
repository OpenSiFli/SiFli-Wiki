# External
This section uses the display driver `nv3051f1`, TP driver `gt911`, and backlight driver `nw9527` as examples to add a new screen using the [external](lcd_driver_Modem) method for the display driver. The specific steps are as follows:
## Copy Similar Display Driver Code and Add to Compilation
- First, find a similar and already [adapted display driver](./已适配屏幕模组列表.md) in the SDK\customer\peripherals directory,
- Copy the entire directory to the external display driver folder and rename the directory to "nv3051f1"
- Rename the display driver .c file inside to nv3051f1.c, and [modify its content](update-lcd-param).
- Change the depend macro in the SConscript file to `LCD_USING_NV3051F1` to include the new file in the compilation.

## Copy Similar TP Driver Code and Add to Compilation
- First, find a similar and already [adapted TP driver](./已适配屏幕模组列表.md) in the SDK\customer\peripherals directory,
- Copy the entire directory to the external display driver folder and rename the directory to "gt911"
- Rename the display driver .c/.h files inside to gt911.c/.h, and [modify its content](update-tp-param).
- Change the depend macro in the SConscript file to `TSC_USING_GT911` to include the new file in the compilation.

## Copy Similar Backlight Driver Code and Add to Compilation
- First, find the aw9364 directory in the SDK\customer\peripherals directory,
- Copy the entire directory to the external display driver folder and rename the directory to "nw9527"
- Rename the driver .c file inside to nw9527.c, and [modify its content](modify-lcd-bl-c-file).
- Change the depend macro in the SConscript file to `BL_USING_NW9527` to include the new file in the compilation.

**Note**: The driver names should be changed to the corresponding display driver names. Add the required drivers (display driver, TP, backlight) as needed.
