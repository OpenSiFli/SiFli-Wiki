# DSI Screen Parameter Configuration

For basic knowledge about MIPI, please refer to the following articles. The basics of MIPI DSI will not be detailed here.

## Preparations Before Configuration
Before configuring the DSI parameters, users need to have a detailed understanding of their screen module's parameters. Please refer to the following list to ensure that you have the necessary information before proceeding with the configuration.
- Number of DSI interface Data Lanes, color format, and maximum frequency
- DSI interface operating mode, Command mode/Video mode, and the different configuration procedures required for each mode.
- Screen resolution and refresh rate
- For Command mode, confirm the screen TE mechanism, whether it is provided through the DSI protocol or through a separate pin.

After preparing the above information, you can configure the screen parameters according to the DSI interface operating mode.

- [Video Mode Parameter Configuration](#Video_mode_conf)

## Command Mode Parameter Configuration
The main configurable parameters for DSI in Command mode include:
- freq  
DSI clock frequency
- color_mode  
Color format, which can be configured as RGB888 or RGB565
- AutomaticClockLaneControl  
Clock automatic control, enabling this will put the clock lane into a low-power state when idle, thus reducing interface power consumption.
- NumberOfLanes  
Number of DSI Data Lanes, up to 2 Data Lanes are supported
- TearingEffectSource  
Configure the source of DSI TE
- TEAcknowledgeRequest  
Enable TE functionality by configuring this
- vsyn_delay_us  
Delay for TE functionality trigger, this function is only effective when TE is enabled, and it configures the delay between the arrival of the TE signal and the actual sending of screen data

The following source code covers all configurations for DSI Command mode. The configurations mentioned above need to be adjusted according to the screen requirements. Other configurations are also described but are not recommended to be changed.
