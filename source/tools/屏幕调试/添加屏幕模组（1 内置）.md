# Built-in
This section uses the display driver `nv3051f1`, TP driver `gt911`, and backlight driver `nw9527` as examples to add a new screen using the [built-in](lcd_driver_Internal) method. The specific content is as follows:
## Copy Similar Display Driver Code and Add to Compilation
- In the SDK\customer\peripherals directory, find a similar and already [adapted display driver](./已适配屏幕模组列表.md),
- Copy the entire directory and rename it to "nv3051f1"
- Rename the display driver .c file inside to nv3051f1.c, and [modify its content](update-lcd-param).
- Change the depend macro in the SConscript file to `LCD_USING_NV3051F1` to include the new file in the compilation.

## Copy Similar TP Driver Code and Add to Compilation
- In the SDK\customer\peripherals directory, find a similar and already [adapted TP driver](./已适配屏幕模组列表.md),
- Copy the entire directory and rename it to "gt911"
- Rename the display driver .c/.h files inside to gt911.c/.h, and [modify their content](update-tp-param).
- Change the depend macro in the SConscript file to `TSC_USING_GT911` to include the new file in the compilation.

## Copy Similar Backlight Driver Code and Add to Compilation
- In the SDK\customer\peripherals directory, find the aw9364 directory,
- Copy the entire directory and rename it to "nw9527"
- Rename the driver .c file inside to nw9527.c, and [modify its content](modify-lcd-bl-c-file).
- Change the depend macro in the SConscript file to `BL_USING_NW9527` to include the new file in the compilation.

**Note**: Here, the driver names should be changed to the corresponding display driver names. Add the required driver (display driver, TP, backlight) as needed.
