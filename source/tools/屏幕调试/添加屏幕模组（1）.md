# Adding Screen Module (1) -- Adding Files (Copying Files)
Adding files (copying files) is mainly divided into SDK 2.4 and later versions ([external](lcd_driver_Modem)) and SDK 2.4 and earlier versions ([internal](lcd_driver_Internal)). The location for copying the relevant files is the same, but the files need to be added to different paths.<br>
The screen module consists of three parts: screen driver, backlight driver, and TP driver. However, if you only need to debug the screen, you only need to complete the file modifications related to the screen driver. The backlight can be used directly, and the TP driver can be left unimplemented, allowing you to proceed with screen debugging.
