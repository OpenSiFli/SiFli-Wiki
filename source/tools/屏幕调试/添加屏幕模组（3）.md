# Add Screen Module (3) -- Modify Kconfig/Menuconfig
Modifying Kconfig/Menuconfig is mainly divided into two categories: SDK 2.4 and later versions ([external](lcd_driver_Modem)) and SDK 2.4 and earlier versions ([internal](lcd_driver_Internal)). The modifications are roughly the same, but the locations where the modifications are stored are different.
