# SPI Screen Parameter Configuration

## Interface Description
In software, SPI interfaces are first categorized into two major types based on whether there is a physical D/CX line: `LCDC_INTF_SPI_DCX_xxx` and `LCDC_INTF_SPI_NODCX_xxx`. Then, they are further classified based on the number of data lines used during bulk data transfer (i.e., 0x2C/0x3C commands), which can be 1~4DATA. Finally, additional labels such as DDR and AUX are added based on whether DDR mode is used and whether PTC assistance is required.

Generally, 3-line SPI refers to interfaces without a physical D/CX line, while 4-line SPI has a physical D/CX line.

The D/CX line pinmux is usually LCDC_SPI_DIO1.

SPI interface command read and write operations are always in single-line mode, but during bulk data transfer (0x2C/0x3C commands), data can be transferred in parallel using 1~4 lines.

| Interface Name | Physical D/CX Line | Parallel Data Lines for 0x2C/0x3C Bulk Data Transfer | Other |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| LCDC_INTF_SPI_DCX_1DATA | Yes | 1 | - |
| LCDC_INTF_SPI_DCX_2DATA | Yes | 2 | - |
| LCDC_INTF_SPI_DCX_4DATA | Yes | 4 | - |
| LCDC_INTF_SPI_DCX_4DATA_AUX | Yes | 4 | Ramless screen |
| LCDC_INTF_SPI_DCX_DDR_4DATA | Yes | 4 | DDR mode |
| LCDC_INTF_SPI_NODCX_1DATA | No | 1 | - |
| LCDC_INTF_SPI_NODCX_2DATA | No | 1 | - |
| LCDC_INTF_SPI_NODCX_4DATA | No | 1 | - |

The following is a waveform diagram for 4-line TE not enabled, showing that the TE waveform is not aligned with the SPI CS falling edge.

### **Frame Rate Testing Method**
* Enable the HAL_LCDC_SYNC_VER configuration. The SPI timing is as shown in the following diagram, where the screen update is synchronized with TE.
- [LCD Display Abnormality Analysis â€” Tearing (tear effect)](https://blog.csdn.net/hexiaolong2009/article/details/79319512)
* In a UI with a very high frame rate, measure the frequency of the TE signal, which represents the screen refresh rate.
