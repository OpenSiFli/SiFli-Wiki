# External
(lcd_driver_Modem)=
## Introduction

This is primarily used for repositories of SDK version 2.4 and later. It is recommended to use this method to place the display driver outside the SDK and run it externally, and to create new display drivers.

## Directory Structure

Here, we use the sf32lb52-lcd_n16r8 board, with the screen module (nv3051f display driver + gt911 touch driver), and the aw9364 backlight driver chip as an example:<br>

## Pulling the SiFli-SDK Repository Code
First, install the required environment. You can refer to the [Quick Start Guide](https://docs.sifli.com/projects/sdk/latest/sf32lb52x/quickstart/index.html). If you have already installed the environment, you can directly [pull the SDK repository code](https://docs.sifli.com/projects/sdk/latest/sf32lb52x/quickstart/install/script/windows.html#sifli-sdk)
